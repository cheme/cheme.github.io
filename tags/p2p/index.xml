      <description>This blog post describes a POC of a Voting Machine. It may look more like a Roadmap or a backlog for myDHT, yet it still is an example of a myDHT application.
The code is hosted on github.
The protocol Description A simple protocol, between each step should be added synchro period where we check distribution or synchro of each peers but it is not done at this point :</description>

      <description>The point of this post is to give a taste of how service are configured within the MyDHT new design. we are going to adapt a test case to run in a single thread.
All changes describe are on &amp;lsquo;MyDHTConf&amp;rsquo; trait implementation for &amp;lsquo;TestLocalConf&amp;rsquo; struct (to create an application this big trait must be implemented : basically it contains the associated types and the initialisation functions of every components).</description>

      <description>Lastly I got some time in my hand (ended my previous job and looking for more low level programming) to refactor some pretty terrible old project of mine.
Even if the refactor is far from complete, the design and its primo implementation is.
This post focus on MyDHT redesign,
Previous design The initial purpose of MyDHT project was to design a library to run a distributed hash table. It evolves to key value peer to peer info exchange with multi-hop request proxying (query proxyied to none connected peers).</description>
