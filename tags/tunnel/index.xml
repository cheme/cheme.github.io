      <description>Last post, we gave some thoughts on tunnel and mydht interaction,concluding that a mydht specific implementation specific for tunnel should be build (and in a second time maybe use it in a transport).
That was done for a single mode of &amp;lsquo;Full&amp;rsquo; tunnel : the mode that does not require caching. Cache usage mode and error reporting implementation are still incomplete but shall follow similar steps.
This post will describe some of the change upon tunnel and mydht, mainly needed to run within multithreaded environment with non blocking transport stream.</description>

      <description>In my previous post I described some aspects of MyDHT crate, basically a library to implement peer2peer application.
In this post I will describe another crates, tunnel; then try to define how it will be used within MyDHT.
Tunnel is a crate for experimenting with different kind of multi hop layered ciphering of content (similar to tor, maybe more like a multihop vpn).
It defines the various traits for operations associated with this problematics : route building, peer proxying, message sending, peer receiving, peer replying.</description>
